Space Maze
=======
Space maze - a game, built as final project for "Introduction to computer science" online course on [EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). Most of the source code was copied from my [initial attempt](https://github.com/Friteee/S.H.A.P.E.) on this project.

This *game* is built in Code::Blocks, using C++ and SDL2 library.

In case of any mistakes in the code feel free to show them.

###Installation for Windows, Linux or Mac os x :
######( Warning : Was not tested on Linux and Mac platfroms, but should work :) )

1. Download latest Code::Blocks from [Codeblocks website](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads) (Compiler should be working with c++11 at least)
2. Open up WIP.cbp in WIP folder.
3. Compile.
