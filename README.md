Space Maze

Space maze - a game, built as final project for "Introduction to computer science" online course on [EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). Most of the source code was copied from my [initial attempt](https://github.com/Friteee/S.H.A.P.E.) on this project.

This *game* is built in Code::Blocks, using C++ and SDL2 library.
